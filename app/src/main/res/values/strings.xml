    <string name="info1">It is advised that when you actually go to test your max you do not start with your estimated max. The estimated max is
    as it implies, an estimate. As you go to test your max work your way up to the estimate by starting with lower weights.
    Also be sure to take all the safety precautions necessary. Having a spotter available is highly recommended.</string>
    <string name="info2">The max weight calculator works best when you use a weight that you can only perform 3-10 reps with, at most.
    This is due to people being able to handle lighter weights better than they can handle heavier weights. One rep maxes
    are really only ideal for big compound exercises like the squat and the bench press, opposed to something like the bicep curl.</string>
